    "Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean**:\n",
    "   - The mean, also known as the arithmetic mean or average, is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of observations.\n",
    "   - Formula: \\( \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \\)\n",
    "   - The mean represents the center or typical value of a dataset. It is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and can be affected by skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median**:\n",
    "   - The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "   - If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "   - The median is robust to outliers and extreme values, making it a more robust measure of central tendency for skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode**:\n",
    "   - The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a given dataset.\n",
    "   - A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal), depending on the frequency distribution of values.\n",

    "3. **Mode**:\n",
    "   - Definition: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a given dataset.\n",

    "Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness in data refers to the measure of asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data points within a dataset. It indicates the degree to which the data deviates from a normal distribution, where the distribution is symmetric around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about skewness in data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symmetry**: In a symmetric distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal, and the distribution is balanced around the central value. In such cases, the skewness is close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Positive Skewness (Right Skew)**: A distribution is said to be positively skewed when the tail of the distribution extends to the right, meaning that the majority of data points are concentrated on the left side of the distribution. In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is typically greater than the median, and the mode is less than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Negative Skewness (Left Skew)**: A distribution is said to be negatively skewed when the tail of the distribution extends to the left, meaning that the majority of data points are concentrated on the right side of the distribution. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is typically less than the median, and the mode is greater than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Effects**: Skewness can impact the interpretation and analysis of data. For example, in positively skewed data, the mean tends to overestimate the central tendency, while in negatively skewed data, the mean tends to underestimate the central tendency. Therefore, it's important to consider skewness when making statistical inferences and decisions based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization**: Skewness can be visually assessed by plotting a histogram or a box plot of the data. A histogram with a longer tail on one side indicates skewness, with the direction of skewness determined by the longer tail.\n",

    "   - **Mean**: Outliers can pull the mean towards their extreme values, resulting in a mean that does not accurately represent the central tendency of the majority of the data.\n",
    "   - **Median**: The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean because it represents the middle value of the dataset. However, extreme outliers can still influence the median, especially if they are near the center of the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Mode**: Outliers do not directly affect the mode, as it represents the most frequently occurring value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measures of Dispersion**:\n",
    "   - **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation, as they contribute to the overall variability in the dataset. Since variance and standard deviation involve squaring the deviations from the mean, outliers with large deviations can have a disproportionate impact on these measures.\n",
    "   - **Range**: Outliers can significantly increase the range of the dataset, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
